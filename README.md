# 2015-2019-US-Imcome-Investigation
## Introduction
Income directly influence citizens' livelihood. In this miniproject, US households income data from 2015 to 2019 is analyzed. This project can help understand income distribution in the US. 2015-2019 household income data is obtained from US Census Bureau website, and all the data is analyzed using Google Collaboratory Notebook. In this project, distribution change ar different income ranges among five years are compared. 
## Industry Problem
How did household income in the US change during the past five years? 
## Original Data
[2015 household income data](https://github.com/zpren1998/2015-2019-US-Imcome-Investigation/blob/main/INCOME%20IN%20THE%20PAST%2012%20MONTHS%20(IN%202015%20INFLATION-ADJUSTED%20DOLLARS).csv)

## Conclusion
Ratio of high income family is increasing within the five years. More comprehensive datasets and charts should be build when more python codes are learnt.
